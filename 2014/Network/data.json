Born in Allegheny, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in May 1894, her family moved to California when she was 10. She was inspired at that early age to become a dancer when she saw Ruth St. Denis perform her exotic \"Epytia\" modern dance in 1914. After much study, Graham brought a different dynamics and interpretation to modern dance, one of sharp angles and natural motion. Graham\u0027s father was an \"alienist,\" a term used at the turn of the century describe a physician who specialized in human psychology. Dr. Graham was interested in the way people used their bodies, and that interest was passed on to his eldest daughter. Martha frequently repeated her father\u0027s maxim of \"Movement never lies.\" Her abstract approach to dance and her minimal use of costumes and set decorations was disconcerting to audiences accustomed to the lovely fluid movements of modern dance introduced earlier by the likes of Isadora Duncan (many critics accused Graham of making dance \"ugly\"). What Graham wanted to evoke with her style of dance was a heightened awareness of life. She eventually developed a strong following and won over the critics. Her dance themes were inspired by America\u0027s past, biblical stories, historical figures, classical mythology, primitive rituals, and surprisingly, psychoanalyst Carl Jung\u0027s writings, Emily Dickinson\u0027s poems, Georgia O\u0027Keeffe\u0027s paintings, and Zen Buddhism. She danced with such a passion that her presence on stage was electrifying. Graham founded the Dance Repertory Theater in New York in 1930. She was the first dancer to receive a Guggenheim fellowship in 1932. From 1931 to 1935, Graham toured the United States in the production \"Electra.\" She was fascinated by different cultures, and her interest in Native Americans of the southwest United States was first embodied in the production \"Primitive Mysteries.\" In 1937, she danced for President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House. Her most famous dance, \"Appalachian Spring,\" was first performed in 1944. Graham gave her last stage performance in 1968, at age 74. In all, she produced 181 original ballets. A year before her death in 1990, she choreographed, at age 95, Scott Joplin\u0027s \"Maple Leaf Rag\"; the show featured costumes by Calvin Klein.", "Website":"<a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0334208/bio' Target='_blank'>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0334208/bio</a>", "Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":25.434783935546875}, {"label":"Mark Haim","x":-84.49712371826172,"y":10.482511520385742,"id":"201","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Clyde Morgan","x":-87.51605987548828,"y":-194.1281280517578,"id":"242","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Tony Silva","x":-180.69937133789062,"y":-130.01611328125,"id":"128","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Mats Ek","x":608.9252319335938,"y":508.313232421875,"id":"77","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Shelley Lee","x":405.3837585449219,"y":-212.66917419433594,"id":"107","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Jeanne Fornarola","x":-469.8384704589844,"y":-796.7998657226562,"id":"36","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Tere O\u0027Connor (1958)","x":-67.60772705078125,"y":361.3889465332031,"id":"231","attributes":{"img":"Tere_O\u0027Connor.jpg", "Bio":"Tere O’Connor has been making dances since 1982 and has created over 35 works for his company.

In the years since, he has choreographed more than 100 dances for his New York-based company, which has performed in nearly all 50 American states as well as in more than 30 foreign countries. Lar\u0027s dances are renowned for their musicality, rhapsodic style and sophisticated formal structures. His radiant, highly technical choreography and deeply humanistic voice have been acclaimed throughout the world. Lar Lubovitch has been hailed by The New York Times as \"one of the ten best choreographers in the world,\" and the company has been called a \"national treasure\" by Variety. Born in Chicago, Lar Lubovitch was educated at the University of Iowa and the Juilliard School in New York. His teachers at Juilliard included Antony Tudor, Jose Limon, Anna Sokolow and Martha Graham. He danced in numerous modern, ballet, jazz and ethnic companies before forming the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company in 1968. Lubovitch made his Broadway debut in 1987 with the musical staging for the Stephen Sondheim/ James Lapine musical, Into the Woods, for which he received a Tony Award nomination. In 1993 he choreographed the highly-praised dance sequences for the Broadway show The Red Shoes. The final ballet from that show joined the repertories of American Ballet Theatre and the National Ballet of Canada. For his work on that show, he received the 1993-94 Astaire Award from the Theater Development Fund. In 1996 he created the musical staging (and two new dances) for the Tony-Award-winning Broadway revival of The King and I. Most recently he devised the musical staging for Walt Disney\u0027s stage version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame in Berlin. In 2004 he was honored with the Elan Award for his outstanding choreography. In addition to his work for stage, screen and television, Lubovitch has also made a significant contribution to the advancement of choreography in the field of ice-dancing. He has created dances for Olympic gold medalists John Curry, Peggy Fleming and Dorothy Hamill and has choreographed a full-length ice-dancing version of The Sleeping Beauty, starring Olympic medalists Robin Cousins and Rosalynn Sumners. For French Olympic skating champions Isabelle and Paul Duchesnay, Lubovitch choreographed a television project based on The Planets by Gustav Holst; telecast by the A\u0026E network in 1995, the program was nominated for an International Emmy Award, a CableACE Award and a Grammy Award. In 2007, to supplement the activities (creating, performing and teaching) of the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company, he founded the Chicago Dancing Company, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to present a wide variety of excellent dance and build dance audiences in his native Chicago. Initiated by Chicago-born Lubovitch (and our Chicago-based dancer Jay Franke), the Chicago Dancing Festival (CDF) was launched in cooperation with Chicago\u0027s Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) and the City of Chicago. The official premiere of the festival was a free one-night-only dance concert at the Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park. More than 8,000 people attended the performance, which featured dancers from seven leading American companies. For 2008, CDF will be expanded to include three days of programming. For his visionary risk-taking in establishing the Festival, Lubovitch was named a \"2007 Chicagoan of the Year\" by the Chicago Tribune.", "Website":"<a href='http://www.lubovitch.org/Company/Lar_Lubovitch/lar_lubovitch.html' Target='_blank'>http://www.lubovitch.org/Company/Lar_Lubovitch/lar_lubovitch.html</a>", "Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":16.95652198791504}, {"label":"Skip Randall","x":-483.0302734375,"y":160.16053771972656,"id":"110","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Netta Yerushalmy","x":192.49708557128906,"y":193.06375122070312,"id":"248","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Louis Greenfield","x":934.0869750976562,"y":42.43762969970703,"id":"293","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Theresa Anne Joseph","x":-511.3553161621094,"y":670.275390625,"id":"190","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Lois Bewley","x":274.0356750488281,"y":-299.3890075683594,"id":"273","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Barry Blumenfeld","x":75.65836334228516,"y":144.36801147460938,"id":"166","attributes":{"img":"Barry_Blumenfield.jpg", "Bio":"Barry Blumenfeld founded the tap/modern dance company, TAPFUSION, in 1997.

Humphrey was an avid and talented student of dance from an early age. In 1917, after graduating from high school and teaching dance in Chicago for four years, she joined the Denishawn dance school and company in Los Angeles. She soon became a leading soloist in the company, and by 1920 she was experimenting in choreography. Her first major work, to Edward MacDowell’s Sonata Tragica, was presented in 1925. The piece possessed such strong choreographic rhythms that Humphrey’s mentor, Ruth St. Denis, later presented it as the first American modern dance performed without music. After a two-year tour of Asia, Humphrey and another Denishawn dancer, Charles Weidman, directed the Denishawn House in New York City until 1928, when they left to form the Humphrey-Weidman school and company, which was active until 1944; Sybil Shearer, Katherine Litz, and José Limón were among the more famous members of their company. Humphrey wanted to create dances that reflected her individuality and were appropriate to contemporary America. To develop a personal technique she spent many hours in front of a mirror and came to believe that all movement fell within the “arc between two deaths,” or the range between motionless balance and falling imbalance incapable of recovery. She understood that every movement a dancer makes away from the centre of gravity has to be followed by a compensating readjustment to restore balance and prevent uncontrolled falling; the more extreme and exciting the controlled fall attempted by the dancer, the more vigorous must be the recovery. As Mary Wigman had utilized space as the ever-present antagonist, so Humphrey made dramatic use of gravity, displaying the human desire for security (balance) in conflict with the urge for progress and adventure (imbalance). Another of her innovative theories held that movement is not always the consequence of emotional impulse but can itself create meaning. Humphrey’s choreography began with experiments in dance theory and as an attempt to reduce dance to pure movement. Water Study (1928) incorporated her theory of fall and recovery and used only nonmusical rhythms (waves and natural human breath and pulse rhythms). Drama of Motion (1930) was themeless and also performed without music; it has been described as one of the first symphonic dances and exemplifies her belief that movement creates its own meaning. After the essentials of her dance form had been successfully established, Humphrey’s work grew more complex, eventually developing into a full theatrical art. Dance of the Chosen (1931; later and better known as The Shakers) added drums, accordions, and incoherent speech to portray the ecstatic nature of the Shakers’ religious fervour. Her trilogy known as New Dance, after the title of the third section, was completed in 1936 but never performed as a whole. The work, often considered her masterpiece, explored human relationships through the so-called symphonic form of dance. With My Red Fires, the second section, portrayed romantic love, a theme previously held unsuitable or too difficult for modern dance. Theater Piece, the work designed to open the trilogy, was co-choreographed with Weidman. Inquest (1944), a social protest and the last work in which she performed, displayed her mastery of both abstraction and stylized gesture. Noted for successful group choreography, Humphrey removed modern dance from the confines of individual emotion. With that theoretical foundation she choreographed a wide variety of works, including her version of James Thurber’s Race of Life; the abstract Passacaglia, danced to Bach’s Passacaglia and Fugue in C Minor; and dances for several Broadway productions.", "Website":"<a href='http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/276354/Doris-Humphrey'

U.S.—died July 21,1968, Los Angeles, Calif.), American contemporary dance innovator who influenced almost every phase of American dance. From an early age Ruth Dennis displayed a marked interest in the theatre and especially in dance. She began dancing and acting in vaudeville and musical comedy shows when she was a teenager, and she appeared in David Belasco’s productions of Zaza, The Auctioneer, and Du Barry. While touring in the last play she was reputedly inspired by a cigarette poster featuring an Egyptian scene of the goddess Isis to begin investigating Asian art and dance. Dennis took the stage name Ruth St. Denis, and in 1906, after studying Hindu art and philosophy, she offered a public performance in New York City of her first dance work, Radha, together with such shorter pieces as The Cobra and The Incense. A three-year European tour followed. She was particularly successful in Vienna, Austria, where she added The Nautch and The Yogi to her program, and in Germany. Her later productions, many of which had religious themes, included the long-planned Egypta (1910) and O-mika (1913), a dance drama in a Japanese style. In 1914 St. Denis married Ted Shawn, her dance partner, and the next year they founded the Denishawn school and company in Los Angeles. During that time, St. Denis’s choreographic style broadened to include group numbers occasionally derived from Occidental as well as Oriental sources. Among her choreographic innovations were “music visualization”—a concept that called for movement equivalents to the timbres, dynamics, and structural shapes of music in addition to its rhythmic base—and a related choreographic form that she called “synchoric orchestra”—a technique, comparable to the eurythmics of Émile Jaques-Dalcroze, that assigned one dancer to interpret the rhythms of each instrument of the orchestra. St. Denis and Shawn separated, both professionally and maritally, in 1931, though they never divorced. St. Denis, who retired briefly from public performance, founded the Society of Spiritual Arts and devoted much of the rest of her life to promoting the use of dance in religion. In 1940, with La Meri (Russell M. Hughes), she founded the School of Natya to continue the teaching of South Asian dance. She resumed performing in 1941 with an appearance at Shawn’s Jacob’s Pillow Festival in Massachusetts, where she continued to appear annually until 1955.

Alexandra Beller/Dances is an ensemble of highly skilled dancer/actors working on the edge between dance and theater. Rich with personal revelations, performances attempt to move, stimulate, impassion and incite the audience. Ripe with metaphor, abstracted narrative and controversial ideas, the dances traffic through the dangerous territory of homophobia, sexism, and emotional isolationism. The company seeks to intersect distinctions between races, nationalities, sexual orientations and political affiliations through a series of artistic collisions. The creations are a truly unique hybrid form, where speaking and moving are essential forces in the creation of meaning.\u2028\u2028As a member of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company from 1995-2001, Alexandra performed in over 50 countries and throughout the U.S. She was a unique and iconic member of the company, created roles in over ten original productions.

after being personally selected by Judith Jamison, making him only the third person to head the Company since it was founded in 1958. Mr. Battle has a long-standing association with the Ailey organization. A frequent choreographer and artist-in-residence at Ailey since 1999, he has set many of his works on Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and Ailey II, and at The Ailey School. The Company’s current repertory includes his ballets In/Side and Strange Humors. In addition to expanding the Ailey repertory with works by artists as diverse as Kyle Abraham, Aszure Barton, Ronald K. Brown, Garth Fagan, Bill T. Jones, Jiří Kylián, Wayne McGregor, Ohad Naharin, and Paul Taylor, Mr. Battle has also instituted the New Directions Choreography Lab to help develop the next generation of choreographers. Mr. Battle’s journey to the top of the modern dance world began in the Liberty City neighborhood of Miami, Florida. He showed artistic talent early and studied dance at a high school arts magnet program before moving on to Miami’s New World School of the Arts, under the direction of Daniel Lewis and Gerri Houlihan, and finally to the dance program at The Juilliard School, under the direction of Benjamin Harkarvy, where he met his mentor, Carolyn Adams. He danced with the Parsons Dance Company from 1994 to 2001, and also set his choreography on that company starting in 1998. Mr. Battle then founded his own Battleworks Dance Company, which made its debut in 2002 in Düsseldorf, Germany, as the U.S. representative to the World Dance Alliance’s Global Assembly. Battleworks subsequently performed extensively at venues, including The Joyce Theater, Dance Theater Workshop, American Dance Festival, and Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival. Mr. Battle was honored as one of the “Masters of African-American Choreography” by the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 2005, and he received the prestigious Statue Award from the Princess Grace Foundation-USA in 2007. He is a sought-after keynote speaker and has addressed a number of high-profile organizations, including the United Nations Leaders Programme and the UNICEF Senior Leadership Development Programme.", "Website":"<a href='http://www.alvinailey.org/about/people/robert-battle' Target='_blank'>http://www.alvinailey.org/about/people/robert-battle</a>", "Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""}, "color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Marc Farre","x":494.0804443359375,"y":-193.79364013671875,"id":"70","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Wendy Rogers","x":-129.58120727539062,"y":410.5843505859375,"id":"164","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Janet Towner","x":-85.04185485839844,"y":-438.6220397949219,"id":"167","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Tiffany Mills","x":-325.8410949707031,"y":674.9517211914062,"id":"124","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Richard Siegal","x":330.10418701171875,"y":569.7828979492188,"id":"371","attributes":{"img":"RSTest.jpg", "Bio":"RICHARD SIEGAL Founder and artistic director of The Bakery Paris–Berlin (2005).

The company has since appeared in important venues for contemporary dance throughout the United States and has toured in Europe twice and in Asia seven times. As a professional choreographer, Mr. Chen is a positive voice for his community, speaking with power and honesty from a distinct perspective, describing his experiences and influences through his work. This important artistic statement combines a repertoire of dances rooted in Chinese legend and folktales which, when fused with Mr. Chen’s awareness, enlightens audiences both familiar and unfamiliar with Asian culture.

The School, established in 1980 in Chinatown, provides year-round classes in ballet, modern dance, creative movement and piano. In 1988, Mr. Chen established The Theater, Chinatown’s first performing arts venue that presents several modern dance series. newsteps, a semi-annual series, supports new choreography through showcase opportunities and production support; the Ear to the Ground series provides commissions and production support for emerging Asian artists; and Co-presentations allows the Theater and studios to support independent modern dance choreographers looking to produce or rehearse their own work. H.T. Chen’s professional credits include choreographing and performing in Off-Broadway productions, television, and the concert stage. He has taught at the Navajo Community College, and the New York University Department of Dance and Dance Education. In 1985, Mr. Chen was choreographer in residence at THE YARD - a Colony for Performing Arts. In addition, Mr. Chen served on the Board of Trustees for Dance Theater Workshop, and has been a board member for Dance/USA, and Pan Asian Repertory Theatre. Working with Dance Theater Workshop’s National Performance Network, Chen coordinated the Asian Arts Partnership Program (AAPP), which serves as an ongoing cultural exchange between American and Asian artists. Mr. Chen has been an Arts America speaker for the United States Information Service (U.S.I.S.) to the Island of Mauritius. Mr. Chen has been the recipient of numerous awards, including three Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1984, 1985 and 1987; a New York State CAPS grant; a Jerome Foundation grant in 1981; and a Meet the Composer grant in 1993.

While studying to become a minister, Shawn suffered a bout of diphtheria at the age of 19, leaving him temporarily paralyzed. On the advice of his physician, he took up dance as a form of physical therapy. Dancing cured Shawn\u0027s paralysis and left him with a passion that would guide and direct him for the rest of his life. Although Shawn\u0027s first dance experience was with a Metropolitan Opera ballerina and he achieved some success as part of an exhibition ballroom team, it was meeting Ruth St. Denis in 1914 that would set his artistic life in motion. They were married that same year. During the next 15 years, the activities of their Denishawn Company and School changed the course of dance history; most of today\u0027s modern dancers trace their ancestry to Denishawn. It was Shawn who first recognized Martha Graham\u0027s potential and he was instrumental in shaping the early careers of Charles Weidman, Doris Humphrey and Jack Cole. While St. Denis provided most of the creative sparks (\"I can inspire like Hell\" was her own assessment of her talents), Shawn had the business sense to make Denishawn a coast-to-coast success. Shawn and St. Denis separated in 1930 and this also brought about the dissolution of the Denishawn Company. With the purchase that same year of a rundown farm in the Berkshires known as Jacob\u0027s Pillow, Shawn laid the groundwork both for his revolutionary company of men dancers and America\u0027s oldest dance festival. In March 1933, Ted Shawn and His Men Dancers gave their first, historic, all-male performance in Boston. By May 1940 when Shawn disbanded the group, the Company had danced for over a million people in all of the United States, in Canada, Cuba and England, having challenged and irrevocably changed the course of American dance. For the final three decades of his life, Shawn became a major impresario, bringing dance to mainstream America through the theater and school at Jacob\u0027s Pillow. To promote his principle of the importance and universality of dance, Shawn introduced countless foreign companies to American audiences, provided opportunities for promising young artists and trained countless students in a full range of dance styles. Shawn orchestrated premieres by both the established and emerging talents of his day including Agnes de Mille, Anton Dolin, Pearl Lang, Merce Cunningham, Anna Sokolow, Alvin Ailey, and Robert Joffrey. There are a number of \"firsts\" achieved by Ted Shawn during his lifetime: •\tThe first American man to achieve a world reputation in dance •\tConceived, choreographed and appeared in one of the first dance films, the Thomas Edison Company\u0027s Dances of the Ages in 1912 •\tThe first American dancer to be awarded an honorary degree by an American college •\tThe first male dancer to be listed in Who\u0027s Who in America Shawn was honored with the Capezio Award (1957), the Dance Magazine Award (1970) and he was knighted by the King of Denmark for his efforts on behalf of the Royal Danish Ballet. Posthumously, Shawn was named as one of America\u0027s Irreplaceable Dance Treasures by the Dance Heritage Coalition in 2000. In spite of declining health, Shawn remained at the helm of Jacob\u0027s Pillow until his death in 1972 at the age of 81. For most of his career he encouraged his students to call him \"Papa\" and his legacy as the artistic father for generations of dancers and teachers suggests that \"Papa\" was a very apt name indeed.", "Website":"<a href='http://www.jacobspillow.org/exhibits-archives/ted-shawn.php' Target='_blank'>http://www.jacobspillow.org/exhibits-archives/ted-shawn.php</a>", "Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":16.30434799194336}, {"label":"Teresa Torkanowsky","x":-190.2937469482422,"y":-260.23822021484375,"id":"211","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Pauline Oliveros","x":245.5482635498047,"y":-681.1392211914062,"id":"195","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Shirley Ririe","x":-445.2078552246094,"y":135.56661987304688,"id":"109","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Roberto Villanueva","x":-660.45458984375,"y":-701.9439697265625,"id":"96","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Roy Lichtenstein","x":592.9862060546875,"y":-428.0110778808594,"id":"245","attributes":{"img":"default.jpg", "Bio":"","Website":"","Works of Art":"<Coming Soon>","Date of Creation":"","Title":"","Composer":"","Music Title":"","Original Cast":"","Collaborators":"","Video Link":""},"color":"rgb(153,9,53)","size":15.65217399597168}, {"label":"Sean Curran","x":19.65402603149414,"y":-64.73685455322266,"id":"382","attributes":{"img":"Sean_Curran.jpg", "Bio":"Seán Curran began his dance training with traditional Irish step dancing as a young boy in Boston, Massachusetts.

He is perhaps best known as the lead choreographer for the Opening Ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which won acclaim worldwide. The Washington Post has called Shen Wei “One of the great artists of our time” and The New York Times proclaimed, “If there is something to write home about in the dance world, it is the startlingly imaginative work of the Chinese-born choreographer Shen Wei.” Admiration for his talent has earned Shen Wei numerous awards, including a MacArthur “Genius” Fellowship (2007), the U.S. Artists Fellow award, and a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship. Other accolades include: Les Etoiles des Ballet2000, awarded by Ballet2000, Europe’s leading international dance magazine; Australia’s Helpmann Award; the Nijinsky Emerging Choreographer Award; the World Economic Forum’s Young Global Leader Honor; the Asian American Arts Alliance Award; and the Algur H.

During his student years, he studied Western visual art, which propelled an interest in modern dance. In 1991, at the age of 23, he became a founding member of the Guangdong Modern Dance Company, the first such company in China. In 1995, upon receipt of a fellowship, he moved to NYC to study with the Nikolais/Louis Dance Lab and was invited to present his work at the American Dance Festival. Invitations to important Asian and European festivals followed. In July 2000, he founded Shen Wei Dance Arts (SWDA), and his Company quickly entered the international touring circuit. Since forming his Company, he has received numerous commissions to support his creative works for Shen Wei Dance Arts including: multiple commissions from the American Dance Festival; 2 from Het Muziektheater Amsterdam; 2 from the Lincoln Center Festival; 2 from the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts; as well as from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Park Avenue Armory, Hong Kong’s New Vision Arts Festival, and the Edinburgh International Festival.

Born in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1901, his artistic interest and abilities were evident from an early age; from the time he attended his first performance of the Denishawn Company he was determined to become a dancer, and at age 19 he received a scholarship to the Denishawn School. Weidman soon became a leading Denishawn dancer partnering Martha Graham and replacing Ted Shawn in important roles. He performed with the company in vaudeville throughout the United States and in concerts in England and Asia. During an extended tour of the Far East, his interest in Asian dance forms was aroused, and he began studies with a Japanese teacher. In 1927, he and Doris Humphrey left Denishawn in protest against the romanticism of the repertory, and together they established a company and a school devoted to exploring a new aesthetic. It was the work of this company and that of their contemporaries, Martha Graham and Hanya Holm, that has come to be known as modern dance. Humphrey and Weidman established new principles of technique involving gravity, fall and recovery, sustained, suspended, and vibratory movement. Incorporating these innovative techniques, the two pioneers choreographed many works together, among them Lysistrata (1930), School for Husbands (1933) and Alcina Suite (1934). After Humphrey’s retirement from performing in 1945, Weidman continued to create dances, perform, and teach. He was especially popular at colleges and universities throughout the United States where he taught many master classes and repertory workshops. He established a school and company of his own – The Charles Weidman School of Modern Dance and the Charles Weidman Theatre Dance Company. In 1960, he created and established the Expression of Two Arts Theatre in New York City where, despite the limitations of the small space , he presented regular weekly performances until his death. Charles Weidman was happy to create and present dances wherever there was an audience for them. Although his first interest was the concert stage, his work was equally successful in the theater, opera, and nightclubs. His large body of work reflects his serious humanist concerns, his wit in depicting human foibles, and, most importantly, his artistic clarity as a choreographer. In his long teaching career, Weidman influenced a great many dancers. Among the best-known artists and directors who studied with him are: Jose Limon, Jack Cole, Gene Kelly, Sybil Shearer, Eleanor King, Bob Fosse, and Alvin Ailey.", "Website":"<a
