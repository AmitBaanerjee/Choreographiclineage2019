                        <li>Danced For - Choreographers for whom you have danced.</li>
                        <li>Studied With - Teachers with whom you have studied.</li>
                        <li>Collaborated With - Artists with whom you have collaborated.</li>
                        <li>Influenced By - People who have significantly influenced your work, such as artists, authors, philosophers, etc. You do not need to have a relationship with this person in order to list them as having an impact on your work.</li>
                    </ol>   
                    <p>If the artist for whom you are filling out this form is related to a lineal artist in more than one way (ex. She both danced for and studied with this person), click "add another relationship with this same lineal artist", notating each type of relationship as a separate entry.</p>
                    <p>If you are still currently dancing, studying, collaborating with or influenced by this person, notate the current year in the END box. </p>
